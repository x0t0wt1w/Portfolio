# About x0t0wt1w


Independent Blockchain Security Researcher specialized in Solidity and EVM-based protocols.

I focus on identifying high-impact vulnerabilities such as invariant violations, protocol-level accounting bugs, access control flaws, and fund-draining attack paths across DeFi systems.

To date, I have reported 19 High-severity and 10 Medium-severity vulnerabilities across public audit contests and private engagements.

I am learning Rust to extend my security expertise to non-EVM blockchain protocols.

Open to full-time roles, private audits, and collaborative audit teams.

## 🔬  Project

[Web3 Smart-Contract Security CTF : Vulnerability & Exploit Lab](https://github.com/x0t0wt1w/WEB3-SECURITY-CTF)

Designed and implemented a hands-on security CTF simulating real-world audit scenarios.
Each challenge demonstrates a concrete vulnerability pattern observed in production protocols.

• Wrote exploit PoCs using Foundry
• Documented root causes and attack paths
• Proposed secure design patterns and mitigations
